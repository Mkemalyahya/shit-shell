# shit-shell
```shit-shell``` is a simple and lightweight CLI written in Python. It's a project built to understand the fundamentals behind how a shell works and also to escape depression and the feeling of hopelessness (but let's digress).

## stuff it can do (FEATURES)
It's a generic and vanilla shell that can run regular commands, check it out:
- ```echo```: **shits** out whatever the fuck you feed it, simple!
- ```pwd```: **shits** out the folder where you're currently chilling in, very nice.
- ```cd```: now, this one lets you change between folders:
  * ```cd ..``` with those extra two dots, is how you go back a folder.
  * ```cd``` with no arguments **shits** you to your home folder.
- ```cls``` or ```clear```: wipes the terminal buffer, a fresh start.
- ```exit```: this one let's you, wait for it... exit the shell ðŸ¤¯, but it'll double-check first to see if you're sure though.

## how to run shit-shell
### dependencies:
- Python 3.xx
- The ```colorama``` library for maximum terminal feces ðŸ˜Ž.

### the steps
1. Okay so first, clone the fucking GitHub repo twin
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/morenaur/shit-shell.git
  cd shit-shell
  ```
2. Install dependencies listed in the ```requirements.txt``` (literally just one fucking module: ```colorama```)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## how to actually use this stinker
You just gotta run this command from the main folder:
```
py main.py or python main.py
```
After running that, you'll see a prompt: ```shit-shell >> ``` and now you're ready to get stinky

### example:
```
shit-shell >> echo yo wsg?
yo wsg
shit-shell >> pwd
\path\to\my\awesome\hentai\folders
shit-shell >> cd ..
shit-shell >> pwd
\path\to\my\awesome\hentai
shit-shell >> exit
Are you sure? (Y/N): y
```
